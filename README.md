# PresidentsProject

Developed for Skill Distillery SD32

This was an evening solo project. We were provided with a text file of basic info for US Presidents.  Using inner classes, anonymous classes, and lambdas, we developed various ways to filter and sort data.

**MVP for this project included:**
- View president data
- Add entry
- Filter by name
- Save to a text file

**I extended this with the following:**
- Use multiple filters/sorts
- Reorder and add/remove filters/sorts
- Manage collections of lists (create new list, delete list)
- Import from one list into another / merge lists
